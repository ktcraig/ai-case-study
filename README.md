# Artificial Intelligence Coming to American Airlines

## Overview and Origin

American Airlines was created through a combination of companies over the past 95 plus years (1). The most notable, first contributor was a company called Robertson Aircraft Corporation founded in 1926 (1). Robertson Aircraft Corporation started carrying mail via plane on April 15, 1926 (2). A small innovation at the time, that would lead to the American Airlines as a global airline with $53 billion in annual revenue and the largest airline fleet in the world with 967 aircraft in 2024 (3,4). American Airlines, also known as “American”, is also one of the largest employers in the airline industry, employing over 132,800 associates in 2024 (5). A publicly traded company, American Airlines joined the S&P 500 after it merged with United Airways a few years prior in 2013 to form the American Airlines Group (6).

 ## Business Activities

American Airlines is focused on safety, efficiency and lessening their environmental impact. The focus on safety is more than brand protection though. Practically, the airline industry in the US is one of the most regulated industries with national governing body, the Federal Aviation Administration and internationally with from International Air Transport Association (IATA) (7). These two regulating bodies control everything from the language used to communicate with air traffic controllers to manufacturing standards when a plane is being constructed. So, how do you innovate within such tight scrutiny? **For American, the answer is simple: Focus on the customer. With their company's purpose of “to care for people on life’s journey,”American aims to provide a world-class aviation experience for all customers (8).** Largely targeted at passenger travel, American’s 2023 revenue for passenger travel alone is $48.5 billion dollars. American prides itself with being the most innovative airline within this massive stage by being the first airline to offer a customer loyalty program,support airport lounges and leading many firsts in pilot diversity (1). In the same vein of customer loyalty programs, American set itself apart in this area by offering a lifetime flight pass called the “AAirpass” starting in 1981 (9). While this program largely sunsetted in 2022, the lucky-holders of existing lifetime passes can still use this unique perk today.

American Airlines operates as a  logistics hub for not only passengers, but also freight all over the world. In 2023, they generated $812 million in revenue from freight and mail cargo (4). This challenges American to operate lucrative routes based on more than business or personal airline travel. They also add routes to consider growing business needs for freight. One example of this is American’s expansion into transatlantic and transpacific flights from their Dallas-Fort Worth base to Europe and Asia starting in 2025 (10). American’s growth strategy requires technology to live at the forefront of everything they do. As seen in the 2022 Southwest “meltdown”, technology in the airline industry can be your strength or can turn into a $1.2 billion dollar mistake (11). Southwest failed to invest in their logistics software and when coupled with strikes, inclement weather and increased holiday traffic, they left customers stranded at airports for nearly a week citing a humanitarian disaster at US airports. 

American isn’t just covering the basics though, they introduced a machine learning solution, dubbed “Smart Gating”, just a year later in 2023 to assist with their busiest Thanksgiving holiday travel days (12). **Smart Gating technology** was introduced to solve a customer and employee friction point of getting to your destination, but being unable to deboard the plane due to no gate assignment. Some of the metrics published by AmericanAirlines.com include: flight taxi time shortened by 20%, carbon dioxide emissions decreased  by 13,000 metric tons annually and savings of 1.4 million gallons of jet fuel annually (12). This technology was initially tested at Dallas-Fort Worth airport but now extends to other large volume hubs for American including Charlotte, NC and Chicago O’Hare. 

While American started the Smart Gating testing in 2021, they also started collecting research to assist in lowering their environmental impact. In 2023, American participated in a study by Google and Breakthrough Energy to explore how to avoid “contrails” which contribute to global warming impacts (14).

American has also explored introducing AI into their customer service experiences with a virtual chat assistant and their investment in AI has only grown with their most recent April 2024 announcement of an upskilling partnership between American Airlines and Intel solely around Artificial Intelligence (AI) education (13). Intel introduced an assessment tool to baseline American Airlines associates and then individualized education for the partnership (13). While no results from the program have been officially released, American’s investment to improve safety and customer impacts is setting the stage for an American Airlines’ future infused with AI. 

## Landscape

The 2023 global economy for the airline industry was estimated at $762.8 billion dollars(15). From August 2023 to July 2024, American Airlines was positioned as the 3rd in US domestic market share despite having the largest fleet (16). For this same time period, American trailed behind market leader Delta with 17.7% and Southwest with 17.5% respectively (16). American Airlines, along with other transportation industries, has been subject to major market fluctuation, most recently with the lack of air travel during the Covid-19 pandemic. To stay ahead of these economic downturns, the industry is focused on being proactive rather than reactive to customer behavior and needs. This includes increasing customer loyalty programs over the last 5-10 years through the iteration of many of American’s ideas. American was the first major airline to introduce a credit card with the introduction of the Air Travel Card in 1936 (17).  Creating retention products that encourage a lifestyle of travel have also been used by top domestic competitors, Delta, Southwest, and United. 

## Results 

American Airlines boasted the following fiscal results for 2023: Annual revenue of $53 billion dollars, Full year net income of $822 million, and GAAP operating cash flow of $3.8 billion dollars (4). Aside from fiscal results, the Bureau of Transportation also measures success through the lens of the customer experience for carriers with annual operating revenue over $20 million dollars.. So how does American measure up? In 2023, American Airlines found success in Available Seat Miles (Carrying capacity) ranking number 2 in the industry but struggled in Loadfactor (profitability for capacity) ranking number 8 in the industry (16). Compared to its peers, American Airlines saw a 5% increase in passengers in 2024 so far but saw an 11% decrease in air cargo carried in 2024 despite ranking number 4 in the industry (16). In comparison, Delta as the current market leader decreased their air cargo by 13% and still ranks number 2 in the market and has increased their passenger count in 2024 by 6.15% (18).

## Recommendations

>According to the 2024 J.D Power Survey for Airline Customer Satisfaction, American Airlines ranked number 3 for customer satisfaction and key findings from the survey found that “building trust” and having a “seamless flight” weighed heavily on customers. 
>
If I were to advise American Airlines, I would recommend they invest in reducing customer friction for delays and cancellations.The current process for cancellations and delays does not take advantage of their virtual chat assistant found on AmericanAirlines.com and is very human centric which can lead to frustration and human-variance in the customer experience. I believe Conversational AI or Voice AI could help gate calls for the most urgent customer frustrations to the front of the line or allow customers to update their flights in a digital experience. From my research it appears that fees and expenses tied to American’s cancellation procedures may need to be incorporated into this process; however, there are other market leaders such as Southwest that allow customers to update, change or modify flights even proactively without having to speak to a representative, regardless of change in cost. Voice AI could also help with de-escalating or measuring the customer sentiment if a human needs to be involved. I believe this would be advantageous to allow for a seamless experience regardless of engagement channel. This aligns with American’s purpose of putting the customer’s life at the center of their mission and would push them further to solve the fallout that technology cannot prevent when it comes to weather events.
